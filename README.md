# Portfolio_Trial_1
Description
This is my personal portfolio website created to practice web development. It is built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

Technologies Used
1. HTML5 for structure
2. Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
3. Bootstrap for ready-made components and grid system
4. JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic content
